# Self-balancing bot

Arduino code for a self balancing bot. PID parameters can still be tuned further but the actual bot has to be properly balanced first. To run the code, the MPU 6050 library is needed. I also make use of the Arduino motor shield library. 

MPU_Calibration arduino code is from [chillibasket.](https://wired.chillibasket.com/2015/01/calibrating-mpu6050/)
